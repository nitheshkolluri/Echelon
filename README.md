**Echelon is a high-fidelity, agent-based market simulation platform designed to test business feasibility.** 

We don't just chat about strategy; we **simulate** it. Echelon injects your startup idea into a living, breathing market of Gemini-powered competitor agents who adapt, negotiate, and fight for market share in real-time.

## 🚀 The Vision

For the **Google Gemini 3 Hackathon**, we built Echelon to answer a simple question:  
*"What if you could A/B test your startup strategy against the world's smartest AI before writing a single line of code?"*

Echelon uses **Gemini 2.0 Flash** to:
1.  **Understand** your unique business concept.
2.  **Generate** a realistic local market with distinct competitor archetypes.
3.  **Simulate** monthly evolution, pricing wars, and consumer demand shifts.
4.  **Explain** the "Why" behind your success (or failure) with executive-level clarity.

## ✨ Key Features

-   **🧠 Agentic Competitors**: Rivals aren't static scripts. They have memory, goals, and strategic personalities (e.g., "Predatory Discounter" or "Premium Boutique").
-   **🌍 Dynamic Simulation Engine**: A deterministic physics engine handles market share, revenue, and churn, while Gemini handles the *strategy* and *logic*.
-   **⚡ Gemini 2.0 Integrated**: Uses the latest Flash model for rapid reasoning, low-latency strategy updates, and complex negotiation simulation.
-   **📊 Live Dashboard**: Watch the battle unfold with real-time graphs, event logs, and success metrics.
-   **🐳 Production Ready**: Fully Dockerized, Next.js 14 App Router, and server-side secure.

## 🛠️ Tech Stack

-   **Frontend**: Next.js 14, React, TailwindCSS, Framer Motion, Recharts
-   **AI Core**: Google Gemini 2.0 Flash (via `@google/genai` SDK)
-   **Simulation**: Custom deterministic typescript math engine + Agentic Reasoning Loop
-   **Deployment**: Docker & Docker Compose

    ```
    
    Then edit `.env.local` and replace `your_gemini_api_key_here` with your actual API key from [Google AI Studio](https://aistudio.google.com/app/apikey).
    
    ```bash
    GEMINI_API_KEY=your_actual_api_key_here
    ```

3.  **Run**
    ```bash
    docker-compose up --build
    ```
    Open [http://localhost:3000](http://localhost:3000)

### Option 2: Local Node

1.  `npm install`
